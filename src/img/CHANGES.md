# imgadm changelog

## 2.0.6

- Change to node-progbar for progress bars.


## 2.0.5

- [OS-2274] Fix `imgadm avail` to not crash if there was a problem accessing
  one or more of the sources. Also improve `imgadm avail` to show results
  from working sources even if one or more are not working.

## 2.0.4

- [OS-2218] Correct `imgadm list` to be able to list images with an origin,
  i.e. incremental images.

## 2.0.3

- [IMGAPI-152, smartos-live#204] Ensure that there is a '@final' snapshot
  of an imported image.

## 2.0.2

- `NoSourcesError: imgadm has no configured sources` now only raised for commands
  that need to use the source URLs.
- DNS resolution of source hosts is done lazily, so can `imgadm install` for example
  without internet access.

## 2.0.1
